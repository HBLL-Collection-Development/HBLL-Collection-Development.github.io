## Overview

Within multinational, national, regional and local studies of the French-speaking, Italian-speaking and related countries of Europe, this collection fund supports the disciplines of history (in the widest interdepartmental sense: social history, economic history, diplomatic history, religious history, etc.), of politics (also in the broad sense), as well as of contemporary and general culture. A separate major collection fund [34131]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34131) is reserved for Germanic and General European Studies (see [separate collection statement]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34131)). There are likewise other funds and other selectors designated for studies of Great Britain, the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe.

The library generally seeks to support teaching and research in the miscellaneous and Romance branches of European Studies at the Teaching level. One exception to this is Holocaust Studies, which we collect at the Research Level. Holocaust courses are taught in a number of departments in at least two colleges. This is an example of a multidisciplinary topic that retains ongoing interest and relevance for teaching and research throughout the years. The collection fund also supports studies of other Western European countries, such as Greece and the Balkans, at a Representative Level as needed. Studies of selected other countries in Europe, especially those in danger of “falling between the cracks,” (e.g., in East Central Europe, Turkey or the Baltics) are likewise supported as needed.

Some of the areas of teaching and research interest in recent decades, in addition to the Holocaust, have included topics related to migration studies, Venice-Ottoman relations, the Italian renaissance, Italian women’s social and religious history, French imperial studies, European religions, intellectual and cultural history, secularization, Benelux studies, French sports history, 19<supth</sup> century Parisian local history, history and philosophy of faux ruins, comparative European politics and European integration. Materials for certain of these topics, those with multidisciplinary aspects, have been acquired in cooperation with other selectors.

The library seeks to support research and teaching through targeted acquisitions, both of new and retrospective materials.  Relevance and potential use for teaching and/<wbr>or research are paramount, and a further factor is the quality of scholarship and presentation. For books, both print and digital formats are collected; where there is a choice, the default is for an e-book unless other factors intervene (faculty preference for paper format, need for better resolution of paper maps and illustrations, etc.) Demand-driven acquisition is used where possible, since it saves money and guarantees usage.

## Subject Librarian Annual Collection Reports

### 2018
A recent area of collecting interest, driven by all three of the Italian faculty who teach courses in the Holocaust or on the Italian writer, Primo Levi, who survived Auschwitz, has been to increase holdings on the Jewish presence in Italy up to and into World War II. This also includes studies on racism and persecution. One of the larger works for this was the Bibliografia italo-ebraica (Italo-Hebraic Bibliography, 1848–1977) which is useful for research needs as well as teaching. In the realm of primary documents, we finished collecting a multivolume set of Italian diplomatic documents. Another emphasis driven by current events and research needs has to do with the immigrants, especially Muslim immigrants, of France and their attempts at assimilation or non-assimilation into society there.

### 2017
Some emphases in firm order collecting to supplement and complement approval purchases for this fund code included works on the French and Belgian colonization and decolonization of parts of Africa, King Louis XIV of France, North African migrants in Italy, and Machiavelli. In the realm of continuations, I continued to build on the correspondence of Napoleon Bonaparte and on that of Theodore Bèze, who played an important role in the Calvinist side of the Reformation. Also enhanced is a multi-volume dictionary of French biography, a multi-volume dictionary of Italian biography, a dictionary of the French labor movement, and Italian diplomatic documents.
