Genealogy and Local History support: Since Fund Code 34140 includes regional, state, city, and local history of the United States, it is particularly valuable for State and Local History research.

## Subject Librarian Annual Collection Reports

### 2018
- The BYU Library supports academic excellence in history, and the history librarian supports course work and research in history using fund codes 34127, 34130, 34140, and 34351.
- Patron input: I seek recommendations from history faculty, students, and other patrons for the purchase of books, journals, and electronic sources to meet their research and educational needs. This includes areas of personal interest, research, teaching, and publications. To accomplish this, I seek to provide relevant resources in a timely manner and to supply relevant and timely library expertise to these assignments.
- Audio Books: Recently there has been a number of requests that audio books be made available.
- This fund code has the largest amount of money in it and is designed to maintain and improve the library collections dealing with the history of the United States from the age of exploration and colonial times to the present. In recent decades, new research interests and course of study have emphasized significant areas and include the topics related to numerous areas including Colonial, New Nation, Age of Jackson, Western Migration, Local History, Ante Bellum, Civil War, Reconstruction, Gilded Age, World War I, Roaring Twenties, Great Depression, World War II, Korean War, Cold War, Vietnam War, and Age of Terror. Areas of emphasis include studies on Women and Gender, Religion, Emigration and Immigration, Civil Rights that include Native Americans, African Americans, and Latinos.
- In addition to these areas, the Fund Code 34140 also supports the collection dealing with state and local history. There is a special emphasis on Utah and other states in the American West along with all the remaining states and possessions of the United States government.
