## Overview

This collection does not serve a specific discipline but rather covers a wide range of scientific topics, often dealing with history or other general discussions about science in the aggregate as opposed to details of specific disciplines. This fund primarily covers the Q (Science â€“ General) call numbers.

This collection is generally maintained at the Representative level. Where needed or requested by faculty, certain sub-topics may be collected at the higher Teaching level.

Selections for the collection are primarily made via approval plans and selection of current topics by the subject librarian. Faculty and patron requests supplement this selection when appropriate. There is a slight focus in new acquisitions on materials related to the history of science as well as materials that attempt to explain science for the non-scientist.
