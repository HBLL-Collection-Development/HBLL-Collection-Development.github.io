## Overview

The HBLL supports the teaching and research needs in the areas of ancient studies, ancient scripture / religion, and philosophy. These three areas, especially ancient studies and ancient scripture / religion, encompass a wide range of topics and serve faculty interdepartmentally. Patrons who use the philosophy collection primarily include campus faculty and students who teach, research, and study philosophy in an undergraduate, degree-seeking capacity. Ancient studies and ancient scripture have a much broader and larger patron-based community. Not only do undergraduate students and their faculty, both Ancient Near Eastern Studies and GE required religious education, use the collection, but so do many students and faculty in other departments, since religion is interdisciplinary. In addition, local residents who are interested in popular titles regarding the Bible and Book of Mormon also frequent the Religion &amp; Family History area of the library.
