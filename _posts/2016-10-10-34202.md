## Overview

Since 2010, the BYU Library no longer maintains a separate US state or municipal documents collection.  As all of these are classified in LC (as opposed to SuDoc for US federal documents) the limited number of acquisitions we have or obtain are interfiled with corresponding monographs in the opens tacks.

Due to curricular and/or research disinterest and near-zero collection use, there is no effort to systematically collect state or municipal documents; additionally, when these types of materials are desired, they are often found in electronic versions at state websites, or are obtainable through InterLibrary Loan.

If Utah state documents are desired but not found at BYU, ILL usually fulfills those requests by using the Utah State Library in Salt Lake City.

The Annotated Utah Code (the compilation of all Utah laws) is available online; however, if a print copy is desired and/or asked for, patrons are referred to the Law Library, which cultivates a robust collection of Utah laws and regulations, which collection is not duplicated in any way in the Lee Library.
