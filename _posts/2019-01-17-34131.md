## Overview

Within multinational, national, regional and local studies of the German-speaking, Dutch-speaking and Nordic countries of Europe, this collection fund supports the disciplines of history (in the widest interdepartmental sense: social history, economic history, diplomatic history, religious history, etc.), of politics (also in the broad sense), as well as of contemporary and general culture. The fund also supports general continent-wide European Studies, including those of the European Union. A separate major collection fund ([34132]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34132)) is reserved for Romance and Miscellaneous European Studies (see [separate collection statement]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34132)). There are likewise other funds and other selectors designated for studies of Great Britain, the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe.

The library generally seeks to support teaching and research in the general and Germanic branches of European Studies at the Teaching level. One exception to this is Holocaust Studies, which we collect at the Research Level. Holocaust courses are taught in a number of departments in at least two colleges. This is an example of a multidisciplinary topic that retains ongoing interest and relevance for teaching and research throughout the years. Materials for selected other countries in Europe, especially those in danger of “falling between the cracks,” (e.g., Ireland, Hungary, etc.) are supported at a Representative Level as needed.

Some of the areas of teaching and research interest in recent decades, in addition to the Holocaust, have included topics related to migration studies, Early Modern economic history, media studies, German-Jewish studies, European religions, Luther and Reformation studies, German Idealism, German cultural history, German women’s studies, secularization, Benelux studies, Anthroposophy, Scandinavian family history, comparative European politics and European integration. Materials for certain of these topics, those with multidisciplinary aspects, have been acquired in cooperation with other selectors.

The library seeks to support research and teaching through targeted acquisitions, both of new and retrospective materials.  Relevance and potential use for teaching and/<wbr>or research are paramount, and a further factor is the quality of scholarship and presentation. For books, both print and digital formats are collected; where there is a choice, the default is for an e-book unless other factors intervene (faculty preference for paper format, need for better resolution of paper maps and illustrations, etc.) Demand-driven acquisition is used where possible, since it saves money and guarantees usage.

The Germanic and General European Studies collections also reflect the interests of the following departments and programs:

- History Department
- Political Science Department
- German Department
- Scandinavian Section of Department of Comparative Arts and Letters
- Interdisciplinary Humanities Section of Department of Comparative Arts and Letters
- Program of International and Area Studies, especially European Studies

Because area studies have cross-disciplinary implications, these collections also offer support for research and teaching in other departments, primarily in the Humanities and Social Sciences as well as in related area studies.

## Annual Collection Reports

### 2018

A recently burgeoning area of German studies has to do with relations and relationships between German-speaking countries and Asia. One requested set of volumes for the collection was the proceedings of a conference on the topic held in Shanghai. For a professor interested in Rudolf Steiner, the father of Anthroposophy, we ordered the early years of Anthroposophic Society’s journals (from the 1920s). Another set made accessible in the German subject area during the year – through digitization rather than purchase – was a Nazi-party serial called “Der Schulungsbrief.” It was in our serials and Auxiliary Storage holdings, a set of propagandistic “schooling” and training messages for young people in Nazi Germany ranging from 1939 to 1942.

### 2017

A funding transfer of $2,000 from the approval profile to firm order choices within the 34131 fund allowed me to be more flexible in ordering titles in support of research and curriculum in such currently relevant areas as immigration in Europe and in the history of the Reformation (500<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the year Luther nailed 95 theses to the church door at Wittenberg). Other additions and upgrades included several more volumes to Reichstagakten (protocols of the Reichstag or Imperial Diet from the time immediately preceding the Lutheran Reformation), Cabinet protocols of Baden & Württemberg (German states) in the interwar period 1918-1933, Cabinet Protocols of the 21st century German Federal government, Holocaust testimonies, Austrian municipal histories, and the complete vernacular works of one of the founders of the field of sociology, Max Weber. Secondary works on the European Union in crisis following the Brexit decision were also given a high priority.
