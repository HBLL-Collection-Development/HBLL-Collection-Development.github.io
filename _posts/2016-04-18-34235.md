## Overview

The library seeks to support teaching and research in Asian area studies. In the context of BYU these are East Asian area studies: China, Japan, and Korea. Support for the small Southeast Asian Studies instructional program is basic; support for South Asian and Central Asian area studies is minimal. The Asian Language and Literature 34235 fund is used to purchase and provide access to materials in all languages to support research and instruction in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the East Asian languages of the Asian and Near Eastern Languages Department.

Increasingly, area studies and language and literature studies are cross-disciplinary. This trend is visible in faculty research interests and in the focus of student research projects and mentored research projects completed under the direction of teaching faculty. These developments and trends in the field must inform our collection acquisition and collection development planning and decisions. Instructional materials for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean language classes are acquired for classes at the 100 through 400 language levels in these languages: reading materials to help students practice from very beginning to advanced levels, selected language textbooks, language reference materials such as dictionaries, and materials in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to support student class papers. Research materials are acquired based on specific research interests of faculty members.

The following guidelines for acquisition and collection emphases have been developed in collaboration with the Asian Studies history and political science teaching faculty and the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean language and literature teaching faculty.
