## Overview

The library supports a collection of juvenile literature in order to provide necessary resources for curriculum usage and personal enjoyment. It is the goal of the Harold. B. Lee Library to support the teaching efforts of the University as such the juvenile literature collection exists primarily to support these efforts. As such it is a collection designed to support those areas that teach the use of juvenile literature as an educational tool and those areas that teach the creation and production of juvenile literature. While first and foremost a teaching collection the juvenile collection also serves to fulfill the personal reading needs of faculty, staff, students, and their families. The juvenile literature collection includes literature and materials that are aimed primarily at a juvenile audience (children from birth to age 19) that is most connected to those topics, formats, genres, and texts that will most likely be used by or serve as examples for students in their future professional careers.

## Disciplines/<wbr>Programs/<wbr>Subject Areas

The juvenile literature collection reflects the interests of the following disciplines, programs, and subject areas:

- Teacher Education (Elementary and Secondary): focuses on the use of juvenile literature as a tool for classroom instruction and reading development.
- Visual Art, Illustration, Animation and Graphic Design: focuses on the art and illustration of juvenile literature as well as the design of the book as object and multimedia connections (i.e. books made into movies, etc.).
- English: focuses on the writing craft and creation of books for a juvenile audience.

## Formats Collected

The library builds the juvenile collection though the acquisition of both of new and retrospective materials. Current material is primarily emphasized, with earlier or out-of-print materials collected to replace damaged or lost copies of significant works; in response to faculty or students requests; or to fill in a gap in existing collections. Relevance and potential use for teaching is paramount consideration for selection. A further factor is the quality of the work and its presentation. Award winning or works of critical acclaim are also targeted. Books of all varieties are to be considered for acquisition in this collection, including picture books, beginning readers, intermediate readers, novels, illustrated novels, chapter books, graphic novels, toy and movable books, biography, and nonfiction. Print resources are preferred. When purchased e-books are normally acquired exclusively though the overdrive platform. Audio books are also purchased and where possible e-formats though overdrive are given preference over physical versions. A few select juvenile periodicals, magazines and journals are collected the are hosed with the collection as part of the regular stacks collections.
