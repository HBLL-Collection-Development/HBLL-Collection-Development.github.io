## Overview

The Sociology Collection of the Library prepares individuals in the study of society and its functions as related to societal well-being. Our collection contributes to the study of sociology at the undergraduate, graduate, and professorial levels. The Sociology Collection includes literature and materials that prepare students and faculty to learn the necessary principles of social science for both future assignments within careers and with dealing with current societal issues.  It includes but is not limited to books and collections related to society, social welfare, and social issues, as well as societal changes and circumstances that may affect the well-being of societies and peoples.

Books and articles of all varieties are to be considered for acquisition in this collection, including audio books, manuals, biographies, compilations, and e-books, with a particular emphasis on research-recommended or research-essential books. Supplementary and basic-recommended books will be considered as well, based on content value. In most cases e-books are preferred to print books if possible.
