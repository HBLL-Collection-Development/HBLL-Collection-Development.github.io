The most frequent publication of status in political science is the monograph, especially one published by a major university press.

### Periodicals

The most desired serial format is periodical, especially Tier 1 periodicals, which we should have in electronic format and with extensive InterLibrary Loan (ILL) capability.

### Reference

Reference materials are less in demand and therefore is a shrinking collection, but certain handbooks or encyclopedias should still be collected with restricted circulation.
