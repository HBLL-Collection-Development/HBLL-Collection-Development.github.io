## Overview

The library seeks to support a collection of Mormon Audio Fiction to support teaching and research in Fiction, English Literature, Folklore, Mormon Studies, as well as to provide and/or supplement recreational reading. Audio books in some form (CD, MP3, even still on cassette tape) are especially popular with those who want to enjoy a book when their circumstances won't allow them to sit down and read one in print. "Readers" can multitask and enjoy and/or study a book while commuting, exercising, doing chores, etc.

Since this collection supports such recreational and/or supplemental "reading" (in Mormon fiction) for students, faculty, and community members, it's not really possible to provide relevant information and statistics on degree programs, student enrollment and graduation, faculty, courses, etc. Please consult the collection development policy for "[Fiction](../34229/)" for more information.
