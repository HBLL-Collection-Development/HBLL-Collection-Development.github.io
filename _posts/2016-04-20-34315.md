## Overview

The library seeks to support the elective classes within the Family and Consumer Sciences Education and Family Life majors as well as personal development and interests of BYU patrons.

## Research interests

Cooking, sewing, crafts, family and social topics from general interest nonfiction. This fund collects from the popular nonfiction supporting this area rather than the scholarly nonfiction which is covered by Quinn Galbraith.

## Departments/Disciplines/Programs/Subject Areas

- Family and Consumer Sciences Education
- Family Life

## Subject Librarian Annual Collections Report

### 2015

- 53 new books added to the collection
- Books added in 2015 have had a total of 62 circulations so far. A significant number are still in process or were only recently catalogued. I recommend revisiting the circulation stats for these 53 books once a full year of data is available for them.

### Program assessments and changes

- In the past this was primarily being used as a cookbooks budget. When I took it over in 2015, I decided to broaden the collecting interests to support the other elective classes within the Family Science department as well.
