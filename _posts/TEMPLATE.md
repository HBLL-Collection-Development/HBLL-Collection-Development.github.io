## Overview

Within multinational, national, regional and local studies of the German-speaking, Dutch-speaking and Nordic countries of Europe, this collection fund supports the disciplines of history (in the widest interdepartmental sense: social history, economic history, diplomatic history, religious history, etc.), of politics (also in the broad sense), as well as of contemporary and general culture. The fund also supports general continent-wide European Studies, including those of the European Union. A separate major collection fund ([34132]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34132)) is reserved for Romance and Miscellaneous European Studies (see [separate collection statement]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34132)). There are likewise other funds and other selectors designated for studies of Great Britain, the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe.

The library generally seeks to support teaching and research in the general and Germanic branches of European Studies at the Teaching level. One exception to this is Holocaust Studies, which we collect at the Research Level. Holocaust courses are taught in a number of departments in at least two colleges. This is an example of a multidisciplinary topic that retains ongoing interest and relevance for teaching and research throughout the years. Materials for selected other countries in Europe, especially those in danger of "falling between the cracks," (*e.g.*, Ireland, Hungary, etc.) are supported at a Representative Level as needed.

Some of the areas of teaching and research interest in recent decades, in addition to the Holocaust, have included topics related to migration studies, Early Modern economic history, media studies, German-Jewish studies, European religions, Luther and Reformation studies, German Idealism, German cultural history, German women's studies, secularization, Benelux studies, Anthroposophy, Scandinavian family history, comparative European politics and European integration. Materials for certain of these topics, those with multidisciplinary aspects, have been acquired in cooperation with other selectors.

The library seeks to support research and teaching through targeted acquisitions, both of new and retrospective materials. Relevance and potential use for teaching and/or research are paramount, and a further factor is the quality of scholarship and presentation. For books, both print and digital formats are collected; where there is a choice, the default is for an e-book unless other factors intervene (faculty preference for paper format, need for better resolution of paper maps and illustrations, etc.)  Demand-driven acquisition is used where possible, since it saves money and guarantees usage.
