## Overview

The library seeks to support teaching and research in Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Research level.

## About the Department

The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry is functionally divided into five research areas: Analytical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry and Biochemistry.

The undergraduate program has degrees in Biochemistry (BS), Chemistry (BA), Chemistry (BS), Chemistry Education (BS), with minors in Chemistry and Chemistry Education. The Chemistry Bachelor of Science degree is the preferred degree designed for students considering an advanced degree (MS or PhD) or for those in preprofessional programs, such as medicine or dentistry. The Biochemistry Bachelor of Science degree is designed for students with an interest in an advanced degree in biochemistry or who may be interested in health-related fields, such as medicine or veterinary medicine. Chemistry Education Bachelor of Science degree provides the preparation necessary for high school teaching. Each major fulfills the Advanced Writing component through the Chemistry 391 course, which has 3â€“4 class periods for library instruction.

The Master's degree in Chemistry (Analytical, Inorganic, Organic, Physical) or Biochemistry is primarily research-based, though there is required coursework. The programs are meant to prepare students to conduct high quality research in government, industry and educational institutions. A minimum of 30 semester hours are required, which include coursework, seminars, research and thesis. A written thesis with an oral presentation and defense is required. There are no library associated courses or classes required for Masters students.

The Doctoral degree in Chemistry (Analytical, Inorganic, Organic, Physical) or Biochemistry is primarily research-based, though there is required coursework. The programs prepare students to conduct high quality research in government, industry and educational institutions. A minimum of 54 semester hours are required, which include coursework, seminars, research and thesis. A written dissertation with an oral presentation and defense is required. Most doctoral students do not have a library component except those in Organic Chemistry. The library teaches a workshop for these doctoral students so that they can pass an electronic information retrieval exam.

## Formats

Chemistry and Biochemistry faculty and students predominantly use online databases and journal articles. Online journal article access is available through publisher packages, database subscriptions, and individual title management. Books are purchased mainly via the YBP approval plan. Three to four times a year faculty are provided with a list of new books from selected YBP slips and queried for firm order requests; very few firm order purchases are made without faculty request. Circulation rates are quite low for monographs. E-books are purchased where possible, to increase accessibility and use.
