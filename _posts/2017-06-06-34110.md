## Collecting Level

The library seeks to support teaching and research in psychology at the Research Level.

## Overview

The psychology collection supports teaching and research at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Its purpose is to provide theoretical, experimental, and applied information for students and faculty at all points in their education or career. Journals, as the primary mode of disseminating research in the psychology discipline, are a critical medium in the collection. Databases that allow students and faculty to find and understand psychology research are also given high priority. Books remain an important part of the collection as well, and are generally selected based on content value and connections to ongoing teaching a research emphases within the departments served. In most cases e-books are preferred to print books if possible.

Subscriptions to online databases such as PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES provide extensive searching of indexed psychology literature. Subscriptions to journals, particularly online journals, provide access to full text research articles.

### Time

Materials published during the last 10 years are collected extensively. Materials published during the previous 20-30 years are collected very selectively. Materials published prior to 1950 are generally not collected unless they have historical value.

### Languages

English is the preferred language and is collected extensively. Other languages are generally excluded or collected very selectively based on unique content that has not been translated into English.

### Geographic Focus

No particular area of the world is favored, however most materials come from North America and Europe.

## Subject Librarian Annual Collection Reports

### 2017

* **Purchases of Significance**
    * SymptomMedia was subscribed to with funds from the psychology monograph budget, the family science librarian's budget, and the new resource request budget. As highlighted on the library A-Z list of databases, &ldquo;SymptomMedia is an online mental health education and training film library available via subscription streaming. Symptom Media's library of over 300 mental health simulations, including a DSM 5 and ICD Guided Film Collection and Assessment Tools, provide viewers with training tools critical for symptom recognition. These innovative films offer visual guideposts to better understand what a particular mental health diagnosis looks like and decreases the stigma for those facing psychological issues.&rdquo;
    * Brain Mapping: An Encyclopidic References was purchases with combined fund from the psychology monograph budget and the neuroscience librarians' budget. As stated on Elsevier's [website](https://www.elsevier.com/books/brain-mapping/toga/978-0-12-397025-1), &ldquo;With over 300 articles and a media rich environment, this resource provides exhaustive coverage of the methods and systems involved in brain mapping, fully links the data to disease (presenting side by side maps of healthy and diseased brains for direct comparisons), and offers data sets and fully annotated color images. Each entry is built on a layered approach of the content â€“ basic information for those new to the area and more detailed material for experienced readers.&rdquo;
  
### 2016

* **Budget Increase**
    * A decision was made to have subject librarians bear the cost of short term loans triggered through the demand driven acquisitions (DDA) program. Over the past several years, patrons have utilized many psychology materials through this program. The psychology monograph budget was increased to compensate for the anticipated increase in charges associated with short term loans.
* **Purchases of Significance**
    * The online *International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences* was purchased with contributions from the psychology monograph fund, family life librarian funds, and general collection funds. This is now recommended as a comprehensive and up-to-date reference work in library instruction sessions for psychology, family life, sociology, etc.

### 2015

* **DDA and Evidence-Based Acquisitions**
    * Psychology-related e-books available through DDA and Wiley's e-book database are heavily utilized, using a substantial portion of allotted monograph funds.
* **Realigning Journal Fund Codes**
    * Departments across the McKay School and Family Home and Social Sciences were previously served by a behavioral science librarian and education librarian. Departments were rearranged to be served by a psychology librarian, family life and sociology librarian, and an education librarian. These three librarians spent considerable time going over journal subscriptions, making sure journals were assigned to the appropriate librarian based on the new arrangement of departments and disciplines.
