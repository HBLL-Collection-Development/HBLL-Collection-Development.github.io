## Formats Collected

### Books

Although electronic titles are generally preferred by the Library, print is the preferred medium by faculty and students for all visual arts materials. Print materials include academic publications, inventory catalogs, art surveys, exhibition catalogs from museums worldwide, artist's monographs (trade and university presses), institutional publications about art, artists, or artistic movements. Additional areas include new trends, iconographical studies, thematic concepts, and artistic genres. Catalogues raisonn√©s (complete works of an artist) and museum catalogs (permanent collections) are also collected.

### Reference materials

These include bibliographies, biographical sources, directories of museums, indexes to art reproductions, and guides to identification of art works; standard reference sources for iconography, architecture, sculpture, museums, etc. Print is acquired when online version is not available, stable, or adequate.

### Audiovisual materials

Documentaries about art and artists are collected, DVD format preferred.

### Periodicals
Electronic format is preferred; print subscriptions are initiated or continued when online is not available or adequate, and depending on availability and preference by faculty and students. Aside from the perspective of research on specific topics, browsing is an extremely important factor for design and art students who constantly look for inspiration and awareness of current trends in the visual arts.

## Languages collected

Materials collected are primarily in English, but also include Italian, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese reflecting seminal scholarship in subjects of interest. Limited acquisitions are made in additional languages, unless the publication has a unique value to the collection.

## Chronological and Geographical Focus

Current material is primarily emphasized, with earlier or out-of-print materials collected to replace damaged or lost copies of significant works; in response to faculty or students requests; or to fill in a gap in existing collections. The collections are international in scope, with all geographical areas included.
