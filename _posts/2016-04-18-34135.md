## Overview

The library seeks to support teaching and research in Asian area studies. In the context of BYU these are East Asian area studies: China, Japan, and Korea. Support for the small Southeast Asian Studies instructional program is basic; support for South Asian and Central Asian area studies is minimal. The Asian Area Studies 34135 fund is used to purchase and provide access to materials in primarily English, with selected important research materials in other Western languages, to support research and instruction in Asian area studies. Language and literature materials written in any language, including all Western languages and Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, are paid for by the Asian Languages fund [34235]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34235). (The [Asian language fund 34235]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34235) also pays for all materials in all subjects in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean that are housed in the Asian Collection.)

Increasingly, area studies are cross-disciplinary. This trend is visible in faculty research interests and in the focus of student research projects and mentored learning projects completed under the direction of faculty. These developments and trends in the field must inform our collection acquisition and collection development planning and decisions. Instructional materials are acquired based on courses taught at BYU; research materials are acquired based on specific research interests of faculty members.

 The following guidelines for acquisition and collection emphases have been developed in collaboration with the Asian Studies faculty.
