## Overview

The library seeks to develop collections in the biological sciences to support teaching and research in the Department of Biology. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the biological sciences, many of these materials are also used by students and researchers in other departments. As these collections support several undergraduate and graduate programs, information resources in the biological sciences are collected at the research level.

## Formats Collected

### Periodicals

Electronic format is highly preferred for most journals and other periodicals. A substantial number of journal titles are acquired through large package deals, though others are maintained through individual subscriptions. In the event that a relevant periodical title is not available in electronic format, a print subscription may be acquired after careful consideration of likely faculty and student use.

### Monographs

When available, electronic books are generally preferred over print books. However, many relevant book titles in the biological sciences are only available in print format. In these instances, the library will continue to acquire these materials in print. Some highly pictorial works may be preferred in print due to higher image resolution.

### Reference materials

When available, dictionaries, encyclopedias, guidebooks, and other reference materials are preferred in electronic format, though these items will also be acquired in print, if necessary. As an exception, natural history field guides (birds, plants, etc.) will be purchased preferentially in print format to allow easier use in remote field locations.

### Audiovisual materials

Audiovisual materials will be acquired as requested by faculty to support learning objectives for specific courses in the biological sciences. These materials will be located in the library's Media Center and will be available for student and faculty checkout. When requested by faculty for class use, streaming licenses can be purchased for videos, if available and reasonably priced.

## Annual Collection Reports

### 2016
- **Notable acquisitions (collections, journals, databases)**
    - 268 monographs purchased 
        - 169 items purchased through approval plans and title standing order
        - 73 items purchased through firm order
        - 14 items were rented for short term loans
        - 12 items were purchased through Demand Driven Acquisitions
    - Worked extensively with department faculty to assess journal needs as part of the library’s journal package cancelation and retention project.


### 2015
- **Notable acquisitions (collections, journals, databases)**
    - *BIOSIS Citation Index* – The library upgraded from the BIOSIS Previews database to the BIOSIS Citation Index. This upgraded resource provides expanded citation information for one of the largest biological sciences databases in the world. As part of this upgrade, the library also purchased backfiles to the database from 1955 to 1980, providing access to all available records for the past 60 years.
    - *JSTOR Global Plants* – The library purchased a subscription to JSTOR Global Plants—the world's largest resource of digitized plant specimens.
    - *HBLL Locked Case Reintegration* – All biological sciences collections in the library's locked case were evaluated. These items were either relocated to the general stacks, sent to auxiliary storage, or withdrawn from the library's holdings.
    - *Science and Maps Reference Collection Weeding Project* – All biological sciences print materials in the library's Science and Maps Reference Collection were evaluated to maintain an up-to-date and useful reference collection. Outdated materials were withdrawn from the library. Other materials with research value but that were not likely to be used as reference sources were returned to the circulating stacks or to auxiliary storage.
    - *Demand Driven and Evidence Based Acquisitions* – A substantial number of monographs in the biological sciences were added to the library's collections through demand driven and evidenced based acquisition models. The vast majority of monographs in the biological sciences were purchased through YBP. Many of the ebooks on this approval profile were automatically added as demand driven acquisitions (DDA). When reviewing YBP slips, all selected ebooks were added as DDA, when available. Additionally, evidenced based purchasing plans were used to acquire ebooks in the biological sciences with Wiley and Elsevier.
