## Overview

The library seeks to support teaching and research in Asian area studies. In the context of BYU these are East Asian area studies: China, Japan, and Korea. Support for the small Southeast Asian Studies instructional program is basic; support for South Asian and Central Asian area studies is minimal. The Asian Area Studies 34135 fund is used to purchase and provide access to materials in primarily English, with selected important research materials in other Western languages, to support research and instruction in Asian area studies. Language and literature materials written in any language, including all Western languages and Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, are paid for by the Asian Languages fund [34235]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34235). (The [Asian language fund 34235]({{ site.github.url }}/policies/34235) also pays for all materials in all subjects in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean that are housed in the Asian Collection.)

Increasingly, area studies are cross-disciplinary. This trend is visible in faculty research interests and in the focus of student research projects and mentored learning projects completed under the direction of faculty. These developments and trends in the field must inform our collection acquisition and collection development planning and decisions. Instructional materials are acquired based on courses taught at BYU; research materials are acquired based on specific research interests of faculty members.

 The following guidelines for acquisition and collection emphases have been developed in collaboration with the Asian Studies faculty.

## Subject Librarian Annual Collection Reports

### 2017
- **Notable acquisitions**
    - SO SHISEKI GAFU. 宋紫石画譜  [So Shiseki's picture album]
        - Edo, Suharaya Shirôemon; Suharaya Môhei, Meiwa 2 [1765]. Recommended by Jack Stoneman to add to our Special Collections materials in Japanese on birds, one of the strengths of our Bruning Collection Japanese rare materials.  I was happy that the Asian Studies 34235 fund had remaining money toward the end of the year to allow us to purchase this set for Special Collections.

- **New faculty**
    - None

- **Liaison actions pertaining to collections**
    - In September I was notified that the Chinese dictionary of Oxford Language Dictionaries Online was due for renewal at a price of $1,132, a 31% increase over the previous year.  Usage was 115 for 2016, $9.84 per use, which is reasonable, but it's still a very expensive dictionary.  Hence I concluded we shouldn't encourage the publisher to believe they can just raise the price as they please.  We cancelled.  
    - I was notified in October that the renewal subscription for Duxiu, the Chinese database that we have subscribed to through a GWLA consortial arrangement, would increase in price by 11% for the coming year.  Before agreeing to this increase, I investigated usage and consulted faculty members.  Usage is low and faculty uniformly do not use it.  Duxiu is set up to retrieve full-text of articles through a second index, China National Knowledge Index, which we do not subscribe to.  So even the few times faculty members searched Duxiu for articles on a topic, they were unable to secure full-text directly but had to go through Interlibrary Loan.  There is nothing wrong with using ILL, but the subscription price for Duxiu is too high just for an index.  Hence I declined to renew our subscription and relayed the reasons to the librarian who is our GWLA contact with Duxiu. 
    - In the fall I received funding to hire two students to divide the books on the Japanese and Korean Reading Shelves by level of reading difficulty: Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced.  I advertised the positions, trained the students, and they set to work.  As I anticipated, both students finished in December.  I hope that this will allow the books to be of greater help to students of Japanese and Korean.  The books will be cataloged with a Japanese Reading plus level location code so that they can be found in the catalog and on the shelves.
