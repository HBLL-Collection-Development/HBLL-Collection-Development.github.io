## Overview

The Family Life Collection plays a significant role in the development of the BYU library. Its purpose is to enrich the study of the family and its associated fields for undergraduate, graduate, doctoral, and professorial use. The Family Life Collection promotes the study of the family, parenting techniques, familial and marital relationships, and negative influences contributing to the deterioration of the family. This includes but is not limited to books and collections relating to the home, the family, and all other influences of family life such as topics in homemaking, parenting, relationships (both emotional and physical), diversity among families, and familial welfare.

Books and articles of all varieties are to be considered for acquisition in this collection, including audio books, manuals, biographies, compilations, and e-books, with a particular emphasis on research-recommended or research-essential books. Supplementary and basic-recommended books will be considered as well, based on content value. In most cases e-books are preferred to print books if possible.

- Strengthening marriage and family
