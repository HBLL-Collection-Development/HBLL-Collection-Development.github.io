# Music

## Purpose of the Collection

The primary purpose of the Music Collection is to support instruction and research for the School of Music. The collection also supports interdisciplinary studies centering on music in other departments and units throughout the university.

## Academic Department Description

The BYU School of Music offers comprehensive music education, with approximately 50 full-time and 50 part-time faculty offering private instruction (vocal and instrumental), ensembles, music education, music theory, music history, composition, ethnomusicology, musicology, commercial music and conducting. The performance curriculum includes emphases in keyboard, strings, voice, woodwinds, brass, and percussion to the master's level. The School of Music is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music.

## Subject Parameters

Collecting activity comprises the Library of Congress classifications M, ML, and MT, which represent music scores, books, journals and databases on the history, literature, and study of music, as well as audio and video media in various formats.

## Scope

### Subjects

Subject areas reflect and support the curriculum, performance, and research interests of the School of Music's faculty and students. The major areas of collecting activity are (1) music and music cultures of the Western tradition in Europe and the United States from the seventeenth century to the present, and (2) the music traditions of diverse world cultures. Contemporary music and composition, including computer music, are also emphasized.

### Language

Music literature within the scope of the collection as outlined above is collected primarily in English, and selectively in French, German, Italian, and Russian. Vocal works (both scores and media) and texts that accompany scores and media are collected in all languages appropriate for specific works.

### Publication dates

Emphasis is on current publications. Older publications, especially music scores, are acquired selectively to fill gaps in the collection.

### Types of Materials Collected

Collecting activity includes books, journals, scores, electronic databases, and media. Scholarly monographs, especially those published by university presses, and composers' complete critical editions, are strongly emphasized. For orchestral works and large choral works, full scores or study scores are collected; for concertos, piano reduction scores are emphasized; for operas, piano-vocal scores are emphasized and full scores are collected selectively; for chamber music scores, the corresponding parts sets are collected if they are available. For each score acquired, several recordings of the same musical work by various performers are generally purchased if available and if the work is not already represented in the recording collection (including subscription audio databases). Dissertations from institutions other than BYU are only acquired on demand. Textbooks are generally not acquired, unless requested by faculty.

### Gift Collections

Music is an area that frequently attracts gifts, particularly from retiring faculty members. Where possible, the music area welcomes gift collections that support the needs of the curriculum and the research interests of the faculty. However, gifts are accepted only carefully and conditionally in conjunction with other apartments impacted by their acceptance (acquisitions and cataloging departments specifically) and if they do not duplicate items already in the collection.

# Dance

## Purpose of the Collection

The primary purpose of the Dance Collection is to support instruction and research for the BYU Department of Dance. The collection also supports interdisciplinary studies centering on dance in other departments and units throughout the university.

## Academic Department Description

The BYU Department of Dance provides a broad base for professional training in both the classroom and the studio. The undergraduate program includes three degrees: a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Dance, a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Dance Education, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in both Dance and in Music Dance Theatre. The Department of Dance is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance.

## Subject Parameters

Collecting activity comprises the Library of Congress classification numbers GV 1580—GV 1796, which at BYU are given the designation MD in place of GV. These numbers represent books, journals and databases on the history, literature, and study of dance, as well as audio and video media in various formats.

## Scope

### Subjects

Collecting areas include: dance history, reception, and criticism (from antiquity to the present); ethnography; performance theory, repertory and technique; production management and administration; design and technology. The collection has been built around Western dance traditions, as well as World Dance, which encompasses dance traditions from other cultures.

## Subject Librarian Annual Collection Reports

### 2018
- **Developing Collections and Managing Content**
    1. Thoroughly evaluate the collections in the ML classification, making decisions about items to move to auxiliary storage or to discard, and decide how to decrease the footprint of materials in the music stacks on level four.<br><br>_Completed: I went through the shelves in the ML shelf by shelf, physically examining each book. I began in March and completed the work during the summer, working my hardest to complete the work so that the shelving deconstruction and reconstruction could take place. I discarded 766 titles and sent 2260 items to auxiliary storage from the regular ML shelves. I worked with Emily Hreha on which ranges of journals from the ML 1- ML 5 group could comfortably be housed in auxiliary storage instead of on the music shelves. For ML 1, we decided to move 8 entire titles and 9 split titles (pre-1990 moved); and for ML 5, we moved 5 entire titles and 9 split titles, freeing up a significant amount of shelf space on level four._<br><br>
    2. Evaluate the VHS collection to determine if the content is available in other formats (streaming or DVD) and make decisions about discarding VHS tapes or moving them to AUX STOR.<br><br>_Completed: Our VHS collection has not been used very much in recent years. We began the collection in 1998, and circulation increased each year until it peaked in 2007, and has been on the decline ever since. For the past three years, only eleven of the possible titles have been used. I checked use of all titles, looked to see which titles are already available in our library in other formats (DVD or streaming) and in a few cases decided to purchase DVDs for popular titles. I also checked for the availability of all the titles in WorldCat. I did not move any titles to auxiliary storage, but of 1026 titles, I discarded 415 titles. There is still some comparison work to be done—it is time consuming—so I anticipate more discards in 2019._<br><br>
    3. _Additional work in Developing Collections and Managing Content beyond set goals:_
        1. I worked closely with two retiring BYU professors, Ron Brough (percussion) and David Brown (trumpet) who wished to donate materials to the library. Since the climate in the library toward donations is a chilling one, I worked hard to diplomatically accept only a small amount of materials from each of them. In both cases, I was able to help each of them identify other people or organizations to whom they could donate, and only accepted one box from each of them to add to library holdings. They were happy with the outcome.
        2. I made decisions about the stand-alone journals, as requested by Robert Murdoch and others in the Library Collections area. I worked with School of Music division heads, the Dance Department and the Theatre and Media Arts department to ensure that my decisions reflected their needs and desires.
        3. After discussions with new faculty member Josh Lindsay (opera) I purchased a new database, _Met Opera on Demand_, to meet the needs of opera faculty and voice students in the School of Music.
        4. I discontinued two databases that were underused: _Singer&#39;s Babel_ (which is not expensive, but had high cost per use) and _Music in Print_ (which is expensive, was set to double in price, and had very expensive cost per use). I sought input, and music faculty were supportive of the decision to cancel these databases.
- **Collection Decisions relative to HARP and VIOLA**
    1. In preparation for the 2019 national competition of the American Harp Society, go through the repertoire list for the competition and ensure that the music is available for BYU harp students. Make this information available on the harp course guide.<br><br>_Completed: I completed this work in January 2018, making purchases where necessary to ensure that all competition repertoire would be available to BYU students who would need it. The lib guide was updated to reflect these materials, and lists were sent to the Harp instructors as well, so that the information was available to those who needed it._<br><br>
    2. _Working with donors in PIVA:_
        1. I worked with Don McInnis, a retiring violist from California who had signed a commitment with the library to donate his materials to the Primrose International Viola Archive ten years ago, but was only ready to donate now. I went through the contents of his extensive collection, making decisions about what to keep, what to discard, and how to handle various elements of his collection. We still have some work to do adding attributions to the library catalog.
        2. I worked with Dr. Tom Tatton, another violist who has made numerous contributions to the library over the last decade. Tom sent me lists of materials he wished to donate via email, and I responded with the materials we wished to add. Tom and his wife Polly then brought the boxes of materials to BYU from their home in California, already divided for general circulation or for special collections. This was a very effective way to work with a donor.
