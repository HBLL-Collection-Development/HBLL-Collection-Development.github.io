## Formats Collected

### Periodicals

Electronic format is highly preferred for most journals and other periodicals. A substantial number of journal titles are acquired through large package deals, though others are maintained through individual subscriptions. In the event that a relevant periodical title is not available in electronic format, a print subscription may be acquired after careful consideration of likely faculty and student use.

### Monographs

When available, electronic books are generally preferred over print books. However, many relevant book titles in recreation management are only available in print format. In these instances, the library will continue to acquire these materials in print.

### Reference materials

When available, dictionaries, encyclopedias, guidebooks, and other reference materials are preferred in electronic format, though these items will also be acquired in print, if necessary.

### Audiovisual materials

Audiovisual materials will be acquired as requested by faculty to support learning objectives for specific courses in recreation management. These materials will be located in the library's Media Center and will be available for student and faculty checkout. When requested by faculty for class use, streaming licenses can be purchased for videos, if available and reasonably priced.

    - *Demand Driven Acquisitions* – A substantial number of monographs in recreation management were added to the library's collections through a demand driven acquisition (DDA) model. The vast majority of monographs in recreation management were purchased through YBP. Many of the ebooks on this approval profile were automatically added as DDA. When reviewing YBP slips, all selected ebooks were added as DDA, when available.
