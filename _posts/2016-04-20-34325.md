## Overview

The library seeks to support research in Library and Information Sciences at the research level. Although the university no longer offers degree programs in library and information sciences, this collection is important in supporting the research endeavors of faculty librarians as well as library administrators, staff, and those currently enrolled in library and information sciences graduate programs. The collection supports all divisions in the library, including Information Technology; Public Services; Scholarly Communications, Assessment, and Personnel; Special Collections; and Technical Services and Collection Development.
