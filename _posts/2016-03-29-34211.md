# Music

## Purpose of the Collection

The primary purpose of the Music Collection is to support instruction and research for the School of Music. The collection also supports interdisciplinary studies centering on music in other departments and units throughout the university.

## Academic Department Description

The BYU School of Music offers comprehensive music education, with approximately 50 full-time and 50 part-time faculty offering private instruction (vocal and instrumental), ensembles, music education, music theory, music history, composition, ethnomusicology, musicology, commercial music and conducting. The performance curriculum includes emphases in keyboard, strings, voice, woodwinds, brass, and percussion to the master's level. The School of Music is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music.

## Subject Parameters

Collecting activity comprises the Library of Congress classifications M, ML, and MT, which represent music scores, books, journals and databases on the history, literature, and study of music, as well as audio and video media in various formats.

## Scope

### Subjects

Subject areas reflect and support the curriculum, performance, and research interests of the School of Music's faculty and students. The major areas of collecting activity are (1) music and music cultures of the Western tradition in Europe and the United States from the seventeenth century to the present, and (2) the music traditions of diverse world cultures. Contemporary music and composition, including computer music, are also emphasized.

### Language

Music literature within the scope of the collection as outlined above is collected primarily in English, and selectively in French, German, Italian, and Russian. Vocal works (both scores and media) and texts that accompany scores and media are collected in all languages appropriate for specific works.

### Publication dates

Emphasis is on current publications. Older publications, especially music scores, are acquired selectively to fill gaps in the collection.

### Types of Materials Collected

Collecting activity includes books, journals, scores, electronic databases, and media. Scholarly monographs, especially those published by university presses, and composers' complete critical editions, are strongly emphasized. For orchestral works and large choral works, full scores or study scores are collected; for concertos, piano reduction scores are emphasized; for operas, piano-vocal scores are emphasized and full scores are collected selectively; for chamber music scores, the corresponding parts sets are collected if they are available. For each score acquired, several recordings of the same musical work by various performers are generally purchased if available and if the work is not already represented in the recording collection (including subscription audio databases). Dissertations from institutions other than BYU are only acquired on demand. Textbooks are generally not acquired, unless requested by faculty.

### Gift Collections

Music is an area that frequently attracts gifts, particularly from retiring faculty members. Where possible, the music area welcomes gift collections that support the needs of the curriculum and the research interests of the faculty. However, gifts are accepted only carefully and conditionally in conjunction with other apartments impacted by their acceptance (acquisitions and cataloging departments specifically) and if they do not duplicate items already in the collection.

# Dance

## Purpose of the Collection

The primary purpose of the Dance Collection is to support instruction and research for the BYU Department of Dance. The collection also supports interdisciplinary studies centering on dance in other departments and units throughout the university.

The undergraduate program includes three degrees: a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Dance, a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Dance Education, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in both Dance and in Music Dance Theatre. The Department of Dance is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance.

## Subject Parameters

These numbers represent books, journals and databases on the history, literature, and study of dance, as well as audio and video media in various formats.

## Scope

The collection has been built around Western dance traditions, as well as World Dance, which encompasses dance traditions from other cultures.

### Language

Materials collected are primarily in English or English translation. Works written in other languages are infrequently acquired, depending on the availability of the items and research needs of faculty members.

### Publication Dates

Materials in the dance collection have been published in the 20th and 21st centuries.

### Types of Materials Collected

The dance collection is comprised of print and electronic monographs, reference tools, video and audio recordings, periodicals, and scholarly series. Conference proceedings are collected selectively.
