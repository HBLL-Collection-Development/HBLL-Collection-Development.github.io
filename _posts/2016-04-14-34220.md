## Overview

The library supports Linguistics and TESOL (Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages) in the sense of general linguistics. Linguistics for specific language families and branches are supported by the relevant language department specialist, e.g., the Spanish subject specialist for Spanish linguistics, the Asian subject specialist for Asian linguistics, Eng English language subject specialist for English linguistics, etc.). Hence, the overall support for Linguistics (writ large) is divided between this 34220 general fund and the individual funds of separate collections. In addition, there is a lot of interdisciplinary involvement for thematic sectors of general linguistics (psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics, etc.), most of which is subsumed under this fund. This fund also supports general, widely applicable materials on language acquisition, while an appropriate language subject specialist funds books or journals on language acquisition for a specific language. In the case of TESOL (Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages) however, this Linguistics budget is the fund supplier. TESOL and language acquisition are major teaching and research areas for the BYU campus.

The library generally seeks to support teaching and research in Linguistics and TESOL at the Teaching level. One exception to this is Mormon Studies, which we collect at the Comprehensive Level, for those who wish to study Mormonism from the linguistic angle. This is an example of a local multidisciplinary topic that retains ongoing interest and relevance for teaching and research throughout the years.

Some of the areas of Linguistic teaching and research interest beyond TESOL and language acquisition in recent decades have included topics related to corpus linguistics; second-language writing; computational linguistics, including data-driven phonology and morphology; language planning; sociolinguistics; anthropological linguistics, including the documentation of endangered languages; semiotics and translation studies. Materials for certain of these topics, those with multidisciplinary aspects as mentioned earlier, are acquired in cooperation with other selectors.

The library seeks to support research and teaching through targeted acquisitions, both of new and retrospective materials. Relevance and potential use for teaching and/<wbr>or research are paramount, and a further factor is the quality of scholarship and presentation. For books, both print and digital formats are collected; where there is a choice, the default is for an e-book unless other factors intervene (faculty preference for paper format, need for better resolution of paper maps and illustrations, etc.)  Demand-driven acquisition is used where possible, since it saves money and guarantees usage.

The Linguistics and TESOL collections also reflect selected interests of the following departments and programs:

- Various language and literature departments
- School of Education

Because language studies have cross-disciplinary implications, other library collections also offer support for research and teaching in other academic departments, primarily in the Humanities and Social Sciences.
