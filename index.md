# Collection Development and Access at the BYU Library

The BYU Library advances the University’s mission to “assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life” by acquiring, organizing, preserving, and providing access to collections that nurture, hasten, and deepen the spiritual and intellectual growth of BYU students and faculty ([Library Mission Statement][1]). Librarians carefully curate collections to align with BYU’s curricular, research, and archival priorities. Library collections provide the breadth necessary for a general education and lifelong learning, and the depth needed for intensive disciplinary study. They inspire resilient faith, intellectual curiosity, experimentation, discovery, and creation. They are dynamic, inclusive, and promote a sense of belonging among all members of the BYU community. By providing extensive and convenient access to challenging, high-quality information, the Library facilitates life-changing educational experiences ([Library Strategic Objectives][2]).

## The Role of Librarians

The Library makes collection development decisions at the lowest organizational level that is practical and appropriate. In most cases, the decision-maker will be the librarian who has been assigned stewardship over that collection. Librarians work collaboratively where stewardships overlap, although a primary steward is identified for every collection, and reclassification, transfer, accession, or withdrawal of items requires that steward’s approval. As with any employee, librarians’ decisions may be reviewed, and department chairs and administrators evaluate librarians’ collection development work annually and during reviews for rank advancement and continuing faculty status. While individual librarians have stewardship for collection development, the purchasing, organization, management, and preservation of collections are the stewardship of the Collections Services Division, and collection description is the stewardship of the Cataloging and Metadata Department.

Librarians develop collections by selecting material to add or withdraw in assigned subject areas and within the constraints of the Library’s financial, space, and employee resources. They regularly assess collections for quality, relevance, and accessibility. They establish and follow collection development policies that define the scope, priorities, and operational approaches to collection development appropriate to the disciplines and programs in their stewardship. Collection development policies are reviewed and approved by designated committees or administrators.

When making decisions about acquisitions and retention, librarians apply their subject expertise and professional experience, as well as consulting recognized sources of library and industry information. The Library invites recommendations for needed resources from students, faculty, and employees and incorporates patron demand-driven and evidence-based acquisition models into its resource selection process.

## General and Special collections

All Library collections fall into one of two categories: general or special. Only rare or particularly valuable materials that meet the parameters of relevant collection development policies are included in special collections, which provides increased security and preservation. In unusual cases, as specified in collection development policies, materials that would normally be housed in general collections may be included in special collections.

## Digital Collections

The Library prefers digital formats for general collections when available, affordable, and appropriate for student and faculty needs. Collection development includes selecting and preparing collections for digitization, and the Library particularly strives to increase access to special collections through extensive and increased digitization efforts. Librarians also develop and curate collections of born-digital material, including archival material, an institutional repository of BYU student and faculty scholarship, and journals published or hosted by the Library. A robust digital preservation program ensures long-term retention and access, just as a physical preservation program does for physical materials.

## Partnerships

The Library supplements collections through document delivery and interlibrary loan programs. The Library seeks collaboration with other libraries, publishers, and information and data aggregators to enhance discovery and access to resources.

## Gifts

The costs of processing, cataloging, and storing gifted materials are significant, so the Library only welcomes gifts that are especially relevant to curricular and research needs, consistent with collection development policies. The Library retains the right to dispose of gifts as it deems appropriate. A [deed of gift][3] should be completed before the Library takes custody of gifted materials. Gifts of more than 100 books and other large or particularly valuable gifts require the approval of designated committees and administrators.

## Requests for Reconsideration of Materials

The Library intentionally collects materials that strengthen faith and promote spiritual development ([D&C 88:118][4]). Because of the breadth of its mission and research orientation, the Library must also make materials available that some may find trivial, challenging, or offensive. Acquisition of such materials does not constitute an endorsement. If the Library receives a request to remove an item from its collections, a decision will be made consistent with collection development policies, based on whether the item is appropriate for the curricular needs and research interests of BYU students and faculty ([Reconsideration of Materials Request form][5]). Access to broad library collections is essential to the free inquiry established by BYU’s [Academic Freedom Policy][6].

## Collection Development Policies, Levels, and Tiers

The Library’s priority is to support the curriculum needs and research interests of BYU students and faculty. After this priority is satisfied, other collection areas established by history, special relationships, or formal agreements will be supported to the extent resources allow. Collection development policies identify the expanse and depth at which the Library develops collections in a discipline or subject area. Policy templates are provided for [general collections][7] and [special collections][8].

General collections are developed at one of the following three levels:

* **Research Level**: Provides resources required for doctoral and terminal degree programs and for religious studies.
* **Teaching Level**: Provides adequate resources to support the coursework of advanced undergraduate and master’s degree programs.
* **Representative Level**: Provides limited, essential materials for reference purposes and introduces and defines a subject in the minimum number of works which will serve the purpose.

Special collections are developed and digitized at one of the following three tiers ([see The Future of Special Collections in the Harold B. Lee Library at BYU][9]):

* **Tier 1**: Provides in-depth but focused collections on the history, culture, and doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other Latter Day Saint movements, as well as the documentary history of BYU (including the University Archives) and rare books. Collecting strategies are complementary rather than competitive or unnecessarily duplicative with the Church History Library.
* **Tier 2**: Provides selective collections in Western Americana, photography, film, and music, particularly where relevant to Latter-day Saint culture and with the conscious goal of supporting BYU’s curriculum.
* **Tier 3**: Provides highly selective collections in other areas, considering the size and nature of related academic programs and their centrality to the University’s mission and goals.

## Access to Collections

The Library strives to provide unrestricted and unmediated access to collections. Exceptions must be rigorously justified. For example, rare, fragile, in-process, confidential, vulnerable, or particularly valuable materials may need special protection. Licensing and donation agreements control access to some content.

Patrons are best served when collections are fully integrated on the general shelves and follow standard circulation policies, unless there is compelling evidence of a need or contractual obligation to separate a collection. For example, when necessary for preservation or protection, rare or valuable materials may be placed in special collections, or materials may be placed in reference collections or course reserve to increase availability. To maximize shelving efficiency and improve patrons’ browsing experience, rarely used material that remains relevant may be placed in closed storage areas, even while it continues to circulate. In rare cases, material that contains or depicts sensitive content may also be housed in closed areas while circulating normally.

All members of the BYU community have equal access to collections, although circulation periods vary (see Checkout Privileges). No collections, spaces, or services should be restricted to or reserved for students or faculty from a particular category such as major, year of study, department, etc. Exceptions are rare and must be rigorously justified.

Employees help patrons understand what they can and cannot do with the intellectual property of others based on the law, the Library’s licensing agreements, or the terms under which materials have been donated. The Library does not impose its own restrictions on patrons’ use or reuse of collection content except to ensure the preservation of fragile or irreplaceable materials, nor does the Library charge patrons for the use or reuse of content from collections, except for some cost-recovery fees.

The Library strictly protects the confidentiality of its patrons and does not inquire about the reasons for their use of materials.
