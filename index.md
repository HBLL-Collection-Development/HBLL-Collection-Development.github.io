# Collection Development Philosophy

The Collection Development Philosophy is guided by and supports the mission of the Harold B. Lee Library, which is to provide information resources and services that:

* *Support educational pursuits*
* *Promote information discovery*
* *Advance scholarship*
* *Nurture lifelong intellectual and spiritual growth*

The Harold B. Lee Library collects, organizes, preserves and provides access to a rich and unique record of human thought and creativity in a variety of formats, in support of the teaching, research and public missions of Brigham Young University. To the degree it is possible and appropriate, the library attempts to provide worldwide discovery and access to its collections. The library fosters peer relationships within the broader library community to better inform its faculty and staff and to contribute to the general discussion and advancement of academic and research library collection development best practice.

The library has limited resources to acquire materials at various collection levels for all subject areas and disciplines. Accordingly, the collection development philosophy embraces interlibrary borrowing and lending programs to supplement and complement its collections. The library accepts gifts on a limited basis and which are consistent with accepted collection development guidelines. The Lee Library participates in consortia arrangements such as the Consortium of Church Libraries and Archives (CCLA), Utah Academic Library Consortium (UALC) and the Greater Western Library Alliance (GWLA), where specific borrowing, lending, and acquisition agreements are formalized. Further, the Lee Library seeks collaboration with other libraries, publishers, information and data aggregators, open access entities, and digital initiatives in order to enhance discovery and access to resources.

Designated librarians and curators have the primary responsibility to collect, manage and maintain resources in designated subject areas and disciplines within the limits of acquisition budgets and other funding supplements. Librarians collect in appropriate and available formats by adapting strategies that provide for the anticipated needs and benefit of patrons. When digital content is available, affordable, and appropriate, it is the preferred resource format. It is recognized that the availability of digital content varies due to disciplinary and geographical circumstances, developments in the publishing marketplace, and technological advances. Librarians assess the Library&rsquo;s collections for quality and accessibility. Librarians use information aggregators, content reviews, professional recommendations, and other subject content specialists and evaluation tools to aid in selection and retention processes. The library invites recommendations for needed resources from students, faculty, and staff and incorporates patron demand driven and evidence based acquisition models into its resource selection process.

The library&rsquo;s first collection priority is to build and maintain strong collections to support university degree programs and faculty research. After this priority is satisfied, other collecting areas that have been established by history, special relationships, or formal agreements will be supported to the extent resources allow. The expanse and depth of collecting resources in the various subject areas and disciplines falls under four collection levels:

* **Representative Level**: Provides limited, essential materials for reference purposes and introduces and defines a subject in the minimum number of works which will serve the purpose
* **Teaching Level**: Provides adequate information resources to support the course work of advanced undergraduate and master&rsquo;s degree programs and sustain independent study
* **Research Level**: Provides published resource materials required for doctoral degree programs
* **Comprehensive Level**: Provides for the acquisition, so far as reasonable, all available significant works of recorded knowledge for a necessarily defined and limited field, *i.e.*, a comprehensive effort to acquire manuscript, archival and ephemeral materials, etc. in addition to published sources. This level creates or maintains a special collection. {See [Note 1](#note1).}

The Collection Development Philosophy is intended to guide the work of subject librarians and curators as well as other library faculty and staff across the Lee Library. Creativity and collaboration among subject librarians is encouraged to enhance development of multidisciplinary collections and effectively leverage collection funds. Collection development statements for specific disciplines or departments describe priorities, operational approaches appropriate to those disciplines, and summary of collection activities. All collection development work is clearly aligned with the strategic goals and priorities of Brigham Young University and is intended to aid in achieving the goal of building, sustaining, and preserving a strong local collection in those areas that are central to the University&rsquo;s programs of teaching and research.
